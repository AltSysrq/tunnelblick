Tunnelblick is a simple Mouse-or-Kinect-driven tunnel shooter created to make a
number of points for the CSM CSCI598B Readings in Software Engineering class.

To compile/run, you need JOGL and OpenNI in your classpath; for example, on
Debian/Ubuntu,
  export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jogl2.jar:/usr/share/java/gluegen2-rt.jar:/usr/share/java/org.OpenNI.jar:.

You don't need a Kinect to run it; by default, move the mouse to move your ship
and left-click to jump. To use the kinnect, run
  java com.servegame.abendstern.tunnelblick.game.Tunnelblick 2.0 true
Position yourself so that the Kinect can see at least your upper body and head,
then gently flap your arms like a bird until the game starts. There is
currently no way to jump with the Kinect controls; you'll need to hold a mouse
to do so.

Destroy enemies to score points and avoid obstacles. When you die, your score
is printed to stdout.
